# Poker

Just another poker game...

BUT WAIT! There's more!

## About Me

Currently I'm a 3rd year undergraduate student attending University of the Pacific pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science, specializing in Software Development.

## Inspiration

I personally just thought this would be a fun project to work on. As I've dealt with sockets in ECPE170 (Computer Systems and Networks), it'll be interesting to utilize what I've learned in class for a game. COMP141 (Programming Languages) had also inspired me as it gave me exposure to a variety of different programming language paradigms and the similarities/differences between programming languages. 
    
## So, Why Python?

Having done some research on what language I should write games in, I've concluded to stick with Python. My reasoning is solely due to the fact that I want a challenge. From my understanding, C, C++, or Java are the most commonly used languages to develop games. However, as I'm already familiar with these languages, I thought it would be more benefitial to try to learn a language I'm not familiar with.

## Goals

- Understand how to work with sockets in Python to allow for communication between users and servers.
- Learn the syntax and semantics of Python.
- Apply concepts from classes.
